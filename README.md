# 📘 Design and Analysis of Algorithms – Lab Solutions (ISL46)

This repository contains **Python implementations** of all programming problems from the **Semester End Examination (SEE)** for the course **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (ISL46)** at **Ramaiah Institute of Technology**. Although the original questions specify C, all programs here are implemented in **Python** with equivalent logic and performance analysis.

Each solution includes:
- ✅ Code implementation
- ⏱️ Time complexity analysis
- 📊 Graphs plotted using `matplotlib`
- 🔍 Traces for selected algorithms

> 📌 Note: This is part of coursework for the term **March 2025 – June 2025**.

## 📝 List of Programs

### 🔎 1. Search Algorithms (with Comparison Count)

- 🔹 Linear Search  
- 🔹 Binary Search  

For varying `n`, trace and compute:
- Number of comparisons
- Formula derivation for best, average, and worst cases

---

### 🔢 2. Time Complexity Analysis with Varying Inputs

Analyze time taken for varying sizes of input `n`:
- **a.** Sum of array elements  
- **b.** Binary equivalent of a decimal number  
- **c.** Print even elements from a matrix  

📈 Graphs show time vs input size.
